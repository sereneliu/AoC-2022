# Learning Log

## Day 0

I loved Advent of Code since my first participation in 2017 and I've been meaning to continue it year after year. Obviously, I have failed to do so thus far. I believe the reason why it was so much easier that first year vs all the subsequent ones is because I didn't have a job back then, so I could just spend the entire day figuring out these puzzles, if I wanted to. I would like to believe that after several years in the industry, I don't need as much time as I used to for these puzzles. On the other hand, the skills I need for work are very different than the skills I need for this. I also barely remember Python b/c I don't use it at work, but hopefully I'll pick it back up quick and learn some new stuff along the way.

## Day 1

Some quick thoughts. I don't know any more algorithms & data structures than I did before, so my initial solutions are very similar to what I would have came up with that first year. On the other hand, I can get to the solution a bit quicker just because I've been a dev long enough now that I don't need to print every line to see what I'm doing. I did still add a print statement here or there for debugging. What took the most time in this first puzzle was simply lots of Googling how to do things in Python, b/c while I had a rough idea, I forgot the exact syntax for certain things. I also spending time exploring using an object instead of a dictionary, but found that was more complex than what I really needed for the first iteration. I'm positive my solution is not the most elegant and I will look at how others solved it in the morning. Not really sure why I'm attempting these puzzles close to midnight when I have no intention of speed running this.
