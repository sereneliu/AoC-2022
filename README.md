# Learning Log

## Day 0

I loved Advent of Code since my first participation in 2017 and I've been meaning to continue it year after year. Obviously, I have failed to do so thus far. I believe the reason why it was so much easier that first year vs all the subsequent ones is because I didn't have a job back then, so I could just spend the entire day figuring out these puzzles, if I wanted to. I would like to believe that after several years in the industry, I don't need as much time as I used to for these puzzles. On the other hand, the skills I need for work are very different than the skills I need for this. I also barely remember Python b/c I don't use it at work, but hopefully I'll pick it back up quick and learn some new stuff along the way.
